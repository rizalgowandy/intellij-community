Reports catch sections which are never executed, despite allowed by Java language specification.
<p>
  While normally, unreachable catch sections are disallowed by Java compiler and reported as compilation errors,
  in some rare cases the analysis mandated by Java language specification is not complete. 
  This inspection provides enhanced analysis and reports some unreachable catch sections which are not reported by the compiler.
  Such sections are redundant and could be safely removed.
</p>
<p><b>Example:</b></p>
<pre><code>
  void method() {
    try { 
      throw new FileNotFoundException(); 
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
      
    }
    catch (IOException e) {
      // this catch is allowed by specification
      // but never executed
    }
  }
</code></pre>
<p>The quick-fix is provided, which removes the redundant catch section:</p>
<pre><code>
  void method() {
    try { 
      throw new FileNotFoundException(); 
    }
    catch (FileNotFoundException e) { 
      
    }
  }
</code></pre>
